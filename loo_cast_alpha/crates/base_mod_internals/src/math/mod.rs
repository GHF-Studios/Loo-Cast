//! # Scope
//! - Provides math types and functionality in the form of horribly-unergonomic but highly-generalized backends.
//!
//! # Architecture
//! Each submodule is represented by the following sub-submodules:\
//! - [`aliases`]: Provides type aliases.
//! - [`shared`]: Provides the respective `*Contract` trait, and the "sub traits" it composes.
//! - [`normal`]: Implements the respective `*Contract` trait generically, and monomorphizes it into `normal` type aliases.
//! - [`usf`]: Implements the respective `*Contract` trait generically, and monomorphizes it into `usf` type aliases.
//!
//! ## More on `shared`:
//! - Provides the `*Contract`  for the respective mathematical object.
//! - This contract is NOT to be implemented manually; it is an implementation detail.
//! - This trait contains default contract stubs for mathematical operations defined in `*Contract`.
//!
//! ## More on `normal`:
//! - Provides the `Normal*` type for the respective mathematical object.
//! - This type is generic, and is locally "monomorphized" into concrete type aliases.
//! - These type aliases and the respective shared `*Contract` trait(s) compose the `normal` facade-facing API for working with these math internals.
//!
//! ## More on `usf`:
//! - Provides the `Usf*` type for the respective mathematical object.
//! - This type is generic, and is locally "monomorphized" into concrete type aliases.
//! - These type aliases and the respective shared `*Contract` trait(s) are the `usf` backbone for working with this module.
//!
//! The (`normal` and `usf`) type aliases and the `*Contract` traits together make up the "public" API for facades to consume.
//!
//! Currently supports the following mathematical objects:\
//! [`scalar`]\
//! [`vector`]\
//! [`matrix`]\
//! [`tensor`]\
//! [`tensor4`]\
//! [`quaternion`]\
//! [`transform`]
