# Loo Cast — Project Overview

**Loo Cast** is a work-in-progress repository that contains both an engine and a game mod built in Rust.

- **Engine**: a runtime for scale-aware simulation (ECS + modular runtime logic).
- **Gameplay (base mod)**: a mod built on top of the engine that provides scripts, configs, and content.

> Status: Active development. Docs and architecture are evolving — see `docs/` for curated references and `documents/` for long-form design notes.

## AI usage notice
Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and GitHub Copilot Chat have been used to assist in the creation of code and documentation within this repository. While these tools can enhance productivity, all content generated with their assistance has been reviewed and validated by a human to ensure accuracy and quality. Still, inconsistencies or errors are bound to turn up from time to time, so please report any issues you find if you feel like it <3

## Quick links

- Docs: `docs/` (TOC in `docs/README.md`)
- Crates: `docs/Crates.md` (differentiates code vs canonical assets)
- Build & Run: `./build.ps1` / `./build.sh` and `./run.ps1` / `./run.sh`
- Design notes: `documents/` (Inadvisable to visit at the present time; WIP!)

---

## Quick start

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
./build.ps1 [dev|fastdev|release]; ./run.ps1 [profile]
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
./build.sh [dev|fastdev|release]; ./run.sh [profile]
```

Build artifacts (mods & assets) are placed under `build/<profile>/`.

## High-level structure

- Repository is a Cargo workspace. Key responsibilities are intentionally split:
  - **`core_mod_api`** — code-only crate: typed APIs, plugin groups, workflows.
  - **`core_mod`** — canonical assets & initialization: configs, scripts-as-assets, models, shaders, and default data.
  - **`base_mod` / `base_mod_api`** — gameplay assets and scripting wrappers (rhai bindings).
  - **`core_mod_macros` / `base_mod_macros`** — procedural macros used internally.
  - **`core_engine`** — runtime binary: loads all mods, register all plugins and plugin groups of all mods, and launches the bevy app.

---

## Canonical asset locations

- `core_mod/assets/configs/` — engine-related configuration files.
- `core_mod/assets/scripts/` — engine-related scripts[^engine_vs_gameplay_assets_note].
- `core_mod/assets/*MY_ASSET_TYPE*/` - other engine-related assets of any kind, e.g.: shaders, models, textures, sound files, etc.
- `base_mod/assets/*MY_ASSET_TYPE*/` — gameplay-related configs, scripts, shaders, models, textures, sound files, etc.

For conventions and guidelines, see `docs/Assets.md`.

## Guidelines for docs

- Prefer short, navigable docs in `docs/` and keep long-form history and design notes in `documents/`.

## Crate summary (short)

| Crate                      | Purpose & focus                             |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `core_engine`              | Runtime binary: composes Bevy plugins & runs app loop. |
| `core_mod`                 | Canonical assets & built-in data; provides init hook for statics. |
| `core_mod_api`             | Code-only API surface: plugins, types, workflows. |
| `core_mod_macros`          | Procedural macros used by core crates. |
| `base_mod`                 | Gameplay mod bundle (scripts, configs, assets). |
| `base_mod_api`             | Scripting bindings (rhai wrappers) for gameplay. |
| `base_mod_macros`          | Helpers for generating scripting wrappers. |
| `bevy_consumable_message`  | Small reusable Bevy message utility. |

See `docs/Crates.md` for more details.

[^engine_vs_gameplay_assets_note]: Note: Almost all scripts should likely be gameplay-related and thus belong in `base_mod/assets/scripts/` instead; it is very rare for scripts to be engine-related!
