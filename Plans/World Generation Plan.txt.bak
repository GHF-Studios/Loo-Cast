Overview

- The Universe is split into Chunks, called Filaments
- A Filament is split into Chunks, called Sectors				=>		(Matter-Abundant): Galactic Space		(Matter-Sparse): Intergalactic Space
- A Sector is split into Chunks, called Regions					=>		(Matter-Abundant): Stellar Space		(Matter-Sparse): Interstellar Space
- A Region is what constitutes, what the player experiences		=>		(Matter-Abundant): Planetary Space		(Matter-Sparse): Interplanetary Space

Continuous Phenomena Categories:
- Galactic
- Intergalactic
- Stellar
- Interstellar
- Planetary
- Interplanetary

There are 2 Types of Phenomena that can be found in the Universe:
1. Discrete Phenomena, like Stars, Planets, Space Stations, Enemy Ships, Black Holes, etc.
2. Continuous Phenomena, like Nebulae, Asteroid Fields, etc.

These Phenomena can be of three Scales:
1. Planetary (The order of magnitude found inside Star Systems)
2. Stellar (The order of magnitude found inside Galaxies, but not in a single Star System)
3. Galactic (The order of magnitude found inside Galaxy Clusters, but not in a single Galaxy)

Regions
	- Intergalactic Space	= Filament Map 	(Contained in a Universe)
	- Interstellar Space	= Sector Map 	(Contained in a Filament)
	- Interplanetary Space	= Region Map 	(Contained in a Sector)
	- Planetary Space		= Object Map 	(Contained in a Region)
