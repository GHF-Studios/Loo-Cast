Spacetime Engine API Overview


Registry
Overview:
	Each registry can uniquely identify and store a specific type of component.
	A registry also stores a general type of [COMPONENT]requests and [COMPONENT]responses;
	specific request and response types within a module do not exist, 
	seeing as every request and response for some given component type has the exact same data layout.
	In fact the layout is even the same across
	so additional specialized request and response types would mean a lot of code duplication.
