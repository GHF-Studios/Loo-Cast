Spacetime Engine Framework Overview

This framework, designed as an enhancement to the Bevy engine, fundamentally revolves around a series of macros that enable the creation of various game development modules such as 
Commands, Events, and Components. Each module type is associated with a specific macro, facilitating the definition of customized modules seamlessly within a Rust module. 
For example, the define_commands_module macro can be used to create specialized modules like EntityCommands or AudioCommands. These framework modules, acting as sub-modules within a Rust module, 
represent managed components of the engine as opposed to native Rust code. This architecture not only modularizes game development tasks but also deeply integrates with Bevy’s ECS, 
providing a streamlined and efficient development experience.


Detailed Module Descriptions

Commands Module
The Commands module is central, designed to handle asynchronous operations and facilitate access to Bevy resources. It employs a custom macro to potentially construct a dependency graph 
by analyzing command interactions, though the precise methodology for this analysis is yet to be determined. The challenges include developing a system to effectively parse and interpret 
dependencies within Rust code, which is crucial for executing commands in an order that respects potentially complex dependencies, forming not merely chains but entire graphs of command dependencies.

Resource Management: 
Each Commands module operates with its own Bevy system to manage resources, leveraging Bevy's scheduler to handle resource allocation dynamically. 
This decentralized approach highlights the need for potential future refinements towards more unified or global resource management strategies to optimize execution 
across multiple command modules and maintain order in command execution.

Execution Strategy: 
The framework's execution strategy for commands critically depends on establishing a reliable dependency graph and a robust system for executing 
commands according to this graph. Current considerations include managing command execution through a series of scheduled events that respect these dependencies, 
potentially restructuring how commands are processed to avoid performance bottlenecks and ensure efficient task handling within Bevy’s ECS framework.


Other Modules (Direct Wrappers)

Each of the direct wrapper modules—Archetypes, Attributes, Components, Events, Primitives, Resources, States, and Systems—serves a specific role in importing types into the framework, 
creating a meta representation of each type that includes necessary identifiers and meta information:

Archetypes, Components, Resources, States, Systems: 
Function as wrappers that not only replicate Bevy's functionalities but also introduce these elements into the engine’s ecosystem, 
allowing them to be recognized and managed as non-primitive, imported entities.

Attributes Module: 
Facilitates annotations for managed types within the framework, specifically designed to apply only to framework-defined types, 
enhancing their functionality and integration within the managed environment.

Events Module: 
Enhances Bevy’s event system by enabling events to be dispatched from any part of the application, not limited to specific systems. 
This module provides a flexible interface for integrating event readers and writers into both Bevy systems and custom commands, emphasizing the utility of events beyond traditional boundaries.

Primitives Module: 
Ensures basic data types are efficiently managed within the framework, adhering to necessary traits for safe and effective use, 
and introduces these primitives into the engine as well-defined entities.


Additional Notes

Components, Resources, States, Events, and Primitives are recognized as possible input types for all commands and systems, with Primitives also serving as possible output types for commands. 
This recognition is crucial for the macros to correctly create the backend infrastructure that supports the definition of such input and output types in a type-safe manner. 
Systems within the framework do not produce outputs, further distinguishing their functional role from that of commands.


Summary

This framework represents a sophisticated extension of the Bevy engine, structured around a series of powerful macros that simplify the declaration and management 
of various game development modules. By enhancing modular capabilities and integrating deeply with Bevy's ECS, the framework aims to streamline the game development process, 
allowing developers to focus more on game logic and design rather than the intricacies of backend management. Each module within the framework is designed to optimize 
specific aspects of game development, from handling primitive data types to managing complex asynchronous tasks, making the entire system both powerful and efficient for 
modern game development needs. Significant challenges remain, particularly in the Commands module, involving the development of dependency graphs and execution strategies 
that respect command dependencies, which are crucial areas for future development and refinement.
