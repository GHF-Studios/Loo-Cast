Explore the idea of adding a 'domain of applicability' for various mechanics and phenomena in the game's universe. This would specify the range of scales over which a particular mechanism is the dominant or relevant force. For example, quantum effects dominate at the smallest scales but become negligible at macroscopic scales, whereas gravitational forces are negligible at small scales but become dominant at larger ones. This adds complexity, depth, and realism to the understanding of each scale.
Additionaly this adds a sort of "temporal depth" to the universe, as these "secondary mechanics" as I will call them now, will often take place in many different scales at different points in time. For example star formation: Stars from from veeeeery large gas clouds/nebulae, but coalesc into significantly smaller (but obviously still huge) structures, namely, stars. This process spans many scales and a lot of time, and thus it's definition adds a lot of universal depth to the universe.
