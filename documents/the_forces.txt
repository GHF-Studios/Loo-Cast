Let's expand  this "terrifying reality" together, shall we?




Okay so, you know what a taijitsu is? Yin and Yang is a taijitsu. Basically it says that the world is "Good" and "Bad" (and they're intertwined, but doesn't matter rn). Now this basically splits the world into 2 forces: Good and Bad. But I believe there are many people who prefer a finer granularity? Like maybe 4 or even more forces? or 8? I like those numbers because they themselves represent a sort of symmetry.

So, here is a proposed set of forces:


Based on the insights from psychology and the various theories of human motivation, here's a comprehensive list of forces that can describe the human world in a nuanced and multi-dimensional manner:

1. Exploration: Encompasses curiosity and the innate human desire to learn, discover, and understand the unknown.

2. Self-Determination: Reflects the drive for autonomy, control over one's life, and the pursuit of personal goals.

3. Connection: Represents the human need for social interaction, love, intimacy, and belonging.

4. Survival: Encompasses basic physiological needs like food, safety, and health, as well as the instinct for self-preservation.

5. Growth: Represents the desire for personal development, including intellectual, emotional, and spiritual growth.

6. Contribution: The drive to give back, help others, and make a positive impact on the world and the lives of others.

7. Recognition: Reflects the desire for acknowledgement, appreciation, and validation from others.

8. Security: Encompasses the need for stability, predictability, and protection from threats.

9. Legacy: The desire to leave something behind, to be remembered, and to have a lasting impact on future generations.

10. Achievement: Focuses on the pursuit of success, accomplishment, and the mastery of skills.

11. Pleasure: The pursuit of joy, pleasure, and sensory satisfaction.

12. Power: The drive for influence, control over others, and dominance in social or professional spheres.

15. Creativity: The drive to express oneself, innovate, and engage in creative and artistic endeavors.

16. Harmony: The desire for inner peace, balance, and a harmonious relationship with the world.

This list integrates various aspects of human motivation and behavior, offering a holistic view of the forces that drive individuals and societies. Each of these forces can be adapted and integrated into your game's narrative and character development, providing a rich and complex backdrop for storytelling and player engagement.
