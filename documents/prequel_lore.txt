The Eclipsed Codex: The Unfathomable Prequel
In the spaces between the Cosmic Pantheon's realms, in the dark corners where even the Trickster fears to tread, lies the legend of the "Eclipsed Codex"—a tome of forbidden knowledge that tells the story of a time before time, a conflict so primal and ancient it predates the universe itself.

The Unspoken Realms
Before the canvas of our universe was stretched, before even the concept of "before" existed, there were the "Unspoken Realms"—dimensions so far removed from our understanding that they defy description. These realms were not made of matter or energy; they existed in states of being we can't even begin to fathom.

The Primordials
In these realms dwelt the "Primordials"—entities so vast and complex that they make the Cosmic Pantheon look like mere shadows. These Primordials weren't just beings; they were entire realities unto themselves. Two among them were the most formidable:

The All-Mother: An entity embodying the ultimate concept of creation, love, and benevolence.
The Abyssal Fiend: Its counter, a force of destruction, hatred, and malevolence so pure it corroded everything it touched.
The Cosmic Schism
The tension between these two ultimate forces led to the "Cosmic Schism," an event so catastrophic that it tore through the fabric of the Unspoken Realms, giving birth to the concept of destruction and creation, of good and evil, and, ultimately, to our universe.

The Echoes of the Primordials
While the Primordials were too vast to enter our universe, echoes of their unimaginable conflict seeped through. These echoes gave birth to the forces we now know as the Cosmic Pantheon. In a way, our Cosmic entities are like children, born from the incomprehensible struggle of these ancient, multi-dimensional beings.

The Eldritch Keys
Scattered throughout the universe are "Eldritch Keys"—artifacts of immense power that are fragments of the Primordials' essence. These keys serve as both weapons and tools, and they are tied to the ultimate revelation of the game. They don't just unlock physical doors, but also barriers between dimensions, potentially granting access to the Unspoken Realms.

The Cosmic Lie
Here lies the ultimate Lovecraftian twist: The Cosmic Pantheon believes they are the ultimate forces of the universe, but they are merely puppets, echoes of something far greater and more terrifying. The Eldritch Keys have the power to awaken them to this horrifying truth.

As players advance through the game, they can discover hidden lore, decipher ancient texts, unlock secret dimensions, and gradually piece together this terrifying backstory. Each revelation would be a puzzle piece, contributing to a picture too vast and horrifying for any one player to comprehend. It will take a community of players to piece together the entire story, and even then, they may wish they hadn't.

Some might discover that the Creator’s "Original Sin" is an Eldritch Key in disguise. Others may find that the Harmonizer's "Celestial Symphony" is a tune derived from the cosmic resonance of the Primordials. Players could even stumble upon the horrifying notion that the "Nihil Sphere" containing The Forgotten is a gateway to the Unspoken Realms, and that its release could lead to an event even more cataclysmic than the Cosmic Schism.

This Lovecraftian layer would make your universe not just expansive but also profoundly unsettling, a place of both awe and dread, where every revelation leads to more questions, and where the ultimate truth might be too horrifying to comprehend.
