  value: The local Hagens are onto something, and I know it. I've had several men
    do reconnaissance and we found out about Illegal Weapon Shipments. One of my
    men also told me, they have some sort of Prototype Weapon. Unfortunately we don't
    have any intel on what exactly it could be. We want you to kill the Hagens and
    destroy the Weapon Shipments, before they get into the wrong hands. Also see
    if you can find out anything about this Prototype Weapon, or if it exists at
    all...
